OpenUnnamed - A Game like it's Name!

I've started this php based browsergame from fragments of another game of me. The plan was/is an open world community designed browser based mmo or something. There is a map editor in real early state, you can walk trought the world, gather things and punch something in battles. The code itselfe is maybe chaotic, and there are tons of ways to do it better. Do it :)

PHP&MYSQL
- Import sql to database
- Enter database settings in src/dbconnect.php
- Copy files in scr/ to server
- login as admin:admin or user:user

If you want try the game go to http://unnamed.alkhemeia.de

Feel free to clone this game and host your own server, be creative and share your extensions.

If there are any problems, you could contact me at admin@alkhemeia.de and i try to help you.

Have fun!
